/**

 @page interrupts Interrupt vectors in use
 
 The interrupt vectors below are used for internal purposes:
 @li ADC_vect: ADC interrupt, required for the AutoMeasurmentMode (sensors.h)
 @li INT1_vect: External interrupt 1, used to handle switch events (switches.h)
 @li TIMER2_OVF_vect: Overflow interrupt for timer2, generates a 36kHz clock
                      as time base and carrier signal for the serial/infrared
                      communications interface (time.h)
